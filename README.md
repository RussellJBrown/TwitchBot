# Twitch Bot

This is a twitch bot that replocates and adds a few extra features from the twitch wager feature.
This bot allows non-partner and non-affliate streamers have the option of using a gambling for their audience. 
I have removed certain elements of this that would give access to my twitch account you will have to add them to your own code to allow the
use of the bot.
